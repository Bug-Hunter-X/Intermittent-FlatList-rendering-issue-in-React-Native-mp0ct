# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered in a React Native application using FlatList to display data fetched from an API.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data successfully, but the FlatList component intermittently fails to render the data, displaying an empty list.  The issue is difficult to reproduce consistently. No errors are thrown, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application on an Android or iOS emulator/device.
4. Observe that the FlatList sometimes displays an empty list even when API data is fetched successfully. (Inconsistency is key to reproducing)

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data state is correctly updated and that the FlatList is re-rendered when the data changes.  See `bugSolution.js` for details.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- JavaScript
